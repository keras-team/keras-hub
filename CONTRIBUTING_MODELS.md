# Model Contribution Guide

KerasHub has a plethora of pre-trained large language models ranging from BERT
to OPT. We are always looking for more models and are always open to
contributions!

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps needed to contribute a new
pre-trained model to KerasHub. For illustration purposes, let's assume that you
want to contribute the DistilBERT model. Before we dive in, we encourage you to
go through our [Getting Started Guide](https://keras.io/guides/keras_nlp/getting_started/)
for an introduction to the library, and our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Detailed Instructions

This section discusses, in details, every necessary step.
### Step 1: Open an Issue / Find an Open Issue

Before getting started with the code, it's important to check if there are any
[open issues](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amodel-contribution)
related to the model you wish to contribute. If there is an open issue, you can
claim it by commenting on the issue and letting us know that you're interested
in working on it. This helps us keep track of who is working on what and avoid
duplicated effort.

If there aren't any open issues, you can create one by clicking the "New Issue"
button on our repository page.

Note that you need not have all the answers or complete knowledge of the inner
workings of the model at the time of opening the issue. But it is appreciated if
you can furnish as much detail as possible to enable us to help you with the
contribution! ðŸ™‚

### Step 2: Add XXBackbone

#### Add the backbone class

Once you've identified the required layers, implement the backbone using [Kerasâ€™ functional API](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/) wrapped in a class.

Compare your code with [`DistilBertBackbone`](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/blob/master/keras_hub/src/models/distil_bert/distil_bert_backbone.py) for structure.

##### Implementation

- Use standard inputs (`token_ids`, `padding_mask`, `pixel_values`, `audio_features`)
- Use `keras.layers` and `keras_nlp.layers` when possible
- For architectural deviations, implement custom layers

Examples:
- Major changes: [`DebertaV3`](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/tree/master/keras_hub/models/deberta_v3)
- Minor tweaks: [Whisper attention layer](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/pull/801/files#diff-8533ae3a7755c0dbe95ccbb71f85c677297f687bf3884fadefc64f1d0fdce51aR22)

Do **not** include `from_presets()` in this PR.

##### Validation Colab

- Load original model weights
- Manually set weights in your KerasHub model
- Compare outputs on sample input for closeness

##### Unit Tests (`xx_backbone_test.py`)

- Check forward pass, output shapes
- Ensure model can be saved and loaded correctly

---

### Step 3: Data Converter

#### Tokenizer / ImageConverter / AudioConverter

The converter transforms raw input into numerical tensors suitable for
preprocessing.

##### Implementation

- **Text**: `XXTokenizer`, subclassing from KerasHub tokenizers
- **Image**: `XXImageConverter`, subclassing from KerasHub ImageConverter - for
  resizing, normalization, augmentation
- **Audio**: `XXAudioConverter`, subclassing from KerasHub AudioConverter for
  extracting features like spectrograms

Include asset loading (e.g., vocab files, normalization stats).

##### Validation Colab

- Show that converted output (tokens, pixels, features) match original behavior

##### Unit Tests

- Validate core logic, asset loading, and consistency

---

### Step 4: Tasks and Preprocessors

#### Preprocessor (`xx_<task>_preprocessor.py`)

Transforms raw input into model-ready format.

##### Implementation

- Class: `XX<Task>Preprocessor`
- Internally uses the relevant `XX<Converter>`
- Handles padding, attention masks, batching, formatting

##### Inputs

- Accept strings, paths, or tensors

##### Outputs

- Dictionary of tensors compatible with the Backbone

##### Validation Colab

- Show that your preprocessor, given raw input, produces the same tensor inputs
(e.g., token_ids, padding_mask, pixel_values) as the original model's complete
preprocessing pipeline.

##### Unit Tests

- Test with various inputs, ensuring correct output shapes and values.

---

#### Task Model (`xx_<task>.py`)

Wraps the backbone and preprocessor with a task head.

##### Implementation

- Class: `XX<Task>`
- Instantiate backbone and preprocessor
- Add a task-specific head (e.g., classifier head, LM head)

##### API

- It should offer simple methods like predict(), fit(), generate() (for
  generative models), detect() (for detection models)

##### Unit Tests

- Test basic usage: instantiation, forward pass with dummy data from the
  preprocessor, and model compilation.

---

### Step 5: Presets and End-to-End Validation


#### Preset Configuration

- Add `xx_presets.py`
- Include model args, checkpoint URLs, vocabulary paths

Use the [Kaggle org page](https://www.kaggle.com/organizations/keras/models)
to stage and test.

#### Preset Tests
The testing for presets is divided into two:
- "Large" tests: validate smallest preset numerics
- "Extra large" tests: loop over all presets, check for successful load/inference

#### Checkpoint Conversion Script (tools/checkpoint_conversion/convert_your_model_checkpoints.py)

- Provide a script that converts weights from their original format (e.g.,
PyTorch .bin, TensorFlow SavedModel) to the Keras H5 format expected by KerasHub.
- This script should be reusable and clearly documented.
- It's crucial for verifying weight conversion accuracy and for future updates.
End-to-End Validation Colab
- This is the most important validation step.

#### End-to-End Colab

- Load task model using `from_preset()`
- Run task (e.g., classification, generation)
- Compare output with original model

#### Numerics Test

- Add a test that loads a preset and compares outputs on fixed inputs

---

### Step 6: Advanced Features (Optional)

Extend utility:

- New Task Models (e.g., TokenClassifier, ImageSegmentation)
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA support)
- Quantization (QLoRA support)
- Model Parallelism (for large models)
