**KerasHub** is a pretrained modeling library that aims to be simple, flexible,
and fast. The library provides [Keras 3](https://keras.io/keras_3/)
implementations of popular model architectures, paired with a collection of
pretrained checkpoints available on [Kaggle Models](https://kaggle.com/models/).
Models can be used with text, image, and audio data for generation, classification,
and many other built in tasks.

KerasHub is an extension of the core Keras API; KerasHub components are provided
as `Layer` and `Model` implementations. If you are  familiar with Keras,
congratulations! You already understand most of KerasHub.

All models support JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch from a single model
definition and can be fine-tuned on GPUs and TPUs out of the box. Models can
be trained on individual accelerators with built-in PEFT techniques, or
fine-tuned at scale with model and data parallel training. See our
[Getting Started guide](https://keras.io/guides/keras_hub/getting_started)
to start learning our API.

## Quickstart

Choose a backend:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"  # Or "tensorflow" or "torch"!
```

Import KerasHub and other libraries:

```python
import keras
import keras_hub
import numpy as np
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
```

Load a resnet model and use it to predict a label for an image:

```python
classifier = keras_hub.models.ImageClassifier.from_preset(
    "resnet_50_imagenet",
    activation="softmax",
)
url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/California_quail.jpg"
path = keras.utils.get_file(origin=url)
image = keras.utils.load_img(path)
preds = classifier.predict(np.array([image]))
print(keras_hub.utils.decode_imagenet_predictions(preds))
```

Load a Bert model and fine-tune it on IMDb movie reviews:

```python
classifier = keras_hub.models.BertClassifier.from_preset(
    "bert_base_en_uncased",
    activation="softmax",
    num_classes=2,
)
imdb_train, imdb_test = tfds.load(
    "imdb_reviews",
    split=["train", "test"],
    as_supervised=True,
    batch_size=16,
)
classifier.fit(imdb_train, validation_data=imdb_test)
preds = classifier.predict(["What an amazing movie!", "A total waste of time."])
print(preds)
```

## Installation

To install the latest KerasHub release with Keras 3, simply run:

```
pip install --upgrade keras-hub
```

To install the latest nightly changes for both KerasHub and Keras, you can use
our nightly package.

```
pip install --upgrade keras-hub-nightly
```

Currently, installing KerasHub will always pull in TensorFlow for use of the
`tf.data` API for preprocessing. When pre-processing with `tf.data`, training
can still happen on any backend.

Visit the [core Keras getting started page](https://keras.io/getting_started/)
for more information on installing Keras 3, accelerator support, and
compatibility with different frameworks.

## Configuring your backend

If you have Keras 3 installed in your environment (see installation above),
you can use KerasHub with any of JAX, TensorFlow and PyTorch. To do so, set the
`KERAS_BACKEND` environment variable. For example:

```shell
export KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

Or in Colab, with:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"

import keras_hub
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to set the `KERAS_BACKEND` **before** importing any Keras libraries;
> it will be used to set up Keras when it is first imported.

## Compatibility

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and plan to
provide backwards compatibility guarantees both for code and saved models built
with our components. While we continue with pre-release `0.y.z` development, we
may break compatibility at any time and APIs should not be considered stable.

## Disclaimer

KerasHub provides access to pre-trained models via the `keras_hub.models` API.
These pre-trained models are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties
or conditions of any kind. The following underlying models are provided by third
parties, and subject to separate licenses:
BART, BLOOM, DeBERTa, DistilBERT, GPT-2, Llama, Mistral, OPT, RoBERTa, Whisper,
and XLM-RoBERTa.
