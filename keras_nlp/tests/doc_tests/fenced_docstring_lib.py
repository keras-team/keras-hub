    Default settings for doctest are configured to run like a repl: one statement
    at a time. The doctest source uses `compile(..., mode="single")`

    So to let doctest act like a notebook:

    1. We need `mode="exec"` (easy)
    2. We need the last expression to be printed (harder).

    To print the last expression, just wrap the last expression in
    `_print_if_not_none(expr)`. To detect the last expression use `AST`.
    If the last node is an expression modify the ast to call
    `_print_if_not_none` on it, convert the ast back to source and compile that.

    Args:
      source: Can either be a normal string, a byte string, or an AST object.
      filename: Argument should give the file from which the code was read; pass
        some recognizable value if it wasnâ€™t read from a file ('<string>' is
        commonly used).
      mode: [Ignored] always use exec.
