class TopPSampler(Sampler):
    """Top-P Sampler class.

    This sampler implements top-p search algorithm. Top-p search selects tokens
    from the smallest subset of output probabilities that sum to greater than
    `p`. Put in another way, top-p will first order token predictions by
    likelihood, and ignore all tokens after the cumulative probability of
    selected tokens exceeds `p`, then select a token from the remaining tokens.

    Args:
        p: float, the `p` value of top-p.
        k: int. If set, this argument defines a
            heuristic "top-k" cutoff applied before the "top-p" sampling. All
            logits not in the top `k` will be discarded, and the remaining
            logits will be sorted to find a cutoff point for `p`. Setting this
            arg can significantly speed sampling up by reducing the number
            of tokens to sort. Defaults to `None`.
        seed: int. The random seed. Defaults to `None`.

    Call arguments:
        {{call_args}}

    Examples:
    ```python
    causal_lm = keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM.from_preset("gpt2_base_en")

    # Pass by name to compile.
    causal_lm.compile(sampler="top_p")
    causal_lm.generate(["Keras is a"])

    # Pass by object to compile.
    sampler = keras_nlp.samplers.TopPSampler(p=0.1, k=1_000)
    causal_lm.compile(sampler=sampler)
    causal_lm.generate(["Keras is a"])
