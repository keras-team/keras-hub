    """Random Sampler class.

    This sampler implements random sampling. Briefly, random sampler randomly
    selects a token from the entire distribution of the tokens, with selection
    chance determined by the probability of each token.

    Args:
        seed: int. The random seed. Defaults to `None`.

    Call arguments:
        {{call_args}}

    Examples:
    ```python
    causal_lm = keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM.from_preset("gpt2_base_en")

    # Pass by name to compile.
    causal_lm.compile(sampler="random")
    causal_lm.generate(["Keras is a"])

    # Pass by object to compile.
    sampler = keras_nlp.samplers.RandomSampler(temperature=0.7)
    causal_lm.compile(sampler=sampler)
    causal_lm.generate(["Keras is a"])
    ```
